# Use this if you want TLS certificates to be issued for the Authorino services. It requires https://cert-manager.io/.
# On the other hand, if you prefer managing the certificates by yourself, make sure to create the Authorino's required TLS secrets beforehand.
# `make deploy` will try to detect whether this should be used and do so automatically if this is the case.
